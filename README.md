### My Pokédex website ####
On the main page of this website I would like to build a functional pokédex, where you can lookup pokemon by name or ID.

#### The Goal ####
- [ ] Recreate the whole pokédex using html and css
- [ ] Make it functional using the Pokémon API
- [ ] Allow the user to go to the next evolution, and to the previous one
- [ ] Show the following information of the pokemon:
    - [ ] Sprite
    - [ ] Name
    - [ ] Moveset
    - [ ] Prevolutions and evolutions
    - [ ] Description/flavor text
    - [ ] ...

#### HTML AND CSS ####
- [ ] Pokedex will be formed into a container so that the site can be expanded
- [ ] To recreate the pokedex it needs 2 panels:
    - [ ] Left Panel
        - [ ] HEADER
            - [ ] Has the angled shape from the picture;
            - [ ] Has a lens
            - [ ] Has three status lights
        - [ ] BODY
            - [ ] Has a screen to show the pokemon's sprite;
        - [ ] FOOTER
            - [ ] has a button to go to the pokémon's wiki
            - [ ] Has a screen showing the current pokemon's ID
            - [ ] Has a keypad to go to the next/previous pokemon
    - [ ] Right panel
        - [ ] HEADER
            - [ ] Has a cutout header matching the left panel's
        - [ ] BODY
            - [ ] Has a display showing extra info on the pokemon
                - [ ] Has a 2*3 grid of buttons to switch between pokemon's information
                    - [ ] Random flavor text
                    - [ ] Evolutions
                    - [ ] Types
                    - -----
                    - [ ] Sprite 1
                    - [ ] Sprite 2
